# UML-Class-Diagram-Creation-and-Code-Generation-Tool

By Rayhaan Quazi

Many software businesses have software designers and software developers. The motivation of this project idea was developed due to the repetitiveness of typing basic lines of code, which slowed down the actual development of the main functionality within a software system. The desired outcome of this project was to slightly bridge the gap between design and development by producing a system that allows a software designer/developer to create and convert a UML class diagram directly into code. This will reduce the time gap between the designing stage and actual development of functionality within a software system.
